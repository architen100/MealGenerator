Overview: 

Basically, I’m going to create a program where a user can get a list of meals that they need to make during that week and with those meals they get a grocery list of the items they need to buy. If the user doesn’t want a randomized meal plan, the user can input the types of meals they want. For example, they can choose if they want a pizza or a sandwich dish. They also have the option to search for what meals they want by ingredients they don’t want. For example, if they don’t want meals containing onions or peanuts. After the user inputs all of their specifications, the program should generate their meal plan for the next 7 days along with the ingredients and recipes for each of those meals. 

Libraries: 
I’m planning on using the ofxJson library (https://github.com/jeffcrouse/ofxJSON) for the wrapper of my jsoncpp. I’m also using additional libraries to help with the layout of my project for example ofxLayout (https://github.com/osiloke/ofxLayout) which allows me to put any classes into rows or columns. Also, ofxDropdown (https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxDropdown) which creates drop down menus using ofxGUI.
